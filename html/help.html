<h1>Map Switcher Help</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>When viewing a map page of a supported mapping service (Google, Bing, OpenStreetMap etc.), click on the links in the MapSwitcher popup to open the same location, or the same route, in another mapping service.</p>

<h2>Problems</h2>

<p>Map Switcher is new - so some issues are to be expected.</p>

<p>Directions can be particularly troublesome, as different mapping services interpret natural language start and end points in very different ways. Sometimes this means the chosen waypoint locations may even be in different cities. Where coordinates are available, these are used instead, but this is not always possible. There's nothing Map Switcher can do about this.</p>

<p>If you find problems, please <a href="https://github.com/david-r-edgar/MapSwitcher/issues">report them</a>. Your feedback is valued.</p>
